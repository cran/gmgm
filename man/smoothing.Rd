\usage{
smoothing(
  gmdbn,
  evid,
  nodes = names(gmdbn$b_1),
  col_seq = NULL,
  n_part = 1000,
  max_part_sim = 1e+06,
  min_ess = 1,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmdbn}{An object of class \code{gmdbn}.}

\item{evid}{A data frame containing the evidence. Its columns must explicitly
be named after nodes of \code{gmdbn} and can contain missing values (columns
with no value can be removed).}

\item{nodes}{A character vector containing the inferred nodes (by default all
the nodes of \code{gmdbn}).}

\item{col_seq}{A character vector containing the column names of \code{evid}
that describe the observation sequence. If \code{NULL} (the default), all the
observations belong to a single sequence. The observations of a same sequence
must be ordered such that the \eqn{t}th one is related to time slice \eqn{t}
(note that the sequences can have different lengths).}

\item{n_part}{A positive integer corresponding to the number of particles
generated for each observation sequence.}

\item{max_part_sim}{An integer greater than or equal to \code{n_part}
corresponding to the maximum number of particles that can be processed
simultaneously. This argument is used to prevent memory overflow, dividing
\code{evid} into smaller subsets that are handled sequentially.}

\item{min_ess}{A numeric value in [0, 1] corresponding to the minimum ESS
(expressed as a proportion of \code{n_part}) under which the renewal step of
sequential importance resampling is performed. If \code{1} (the default),
this step is performed at each time slice.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether subsets of \code{evid} and
time slices in progress are displayed.}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with a structure similar to \code{evid}
containing the estimated values of the inferred nodes and their observation
sequences (if \code{col_seq} is not \code{NULL}).
}
\description{
This function performs smoothing inference in a Gaussian mixture dynamic
Bayesian network. For a sequence of \eqn{T} time slices, this task consists
in estimating the state of the system at each time slice \eqn{t}
(for \ifelse{html}{\out{1 &le; <i>t</i> &le; <i>T</i>}}{\eqn{1 \le t \le T}})
given all the data (the evidence) collected up to \eqn{T}. Smoothing
inference is performed by sequential importance resampling, which is a
particle-based approximate method (Koller and Friedman, 2009).
