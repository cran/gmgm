\usage{
em(
  gmm,
  data,
  regul = 0.01,
  epsilon = 1e-06,
  max_iter_em = 100,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmm}{An initial object of class \code{gmm}.}

\item{data}{A data frame or numeric matrix containing the data used in the
EM algorithm. Its columns must explicitly be named after the variables of
\code{gmm} and must not contain missing values.}

\item{regul}{A positive numeric value corresponding to the regularization
constant if a Bayesian regularization is applied. If \code{NULL}, no
regularization is applied.}

\item{epsilon}{A positive numeric value corresponding to the convergence
threshold for the increase in log-likelihood.}

\item{max_iter_em}{A non-negative integer corresponding to the maximum number
of iterations.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether iterations in progress
are displayed.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{gmm}{The final \code{gmm} object.}
\item{posterior}{A numeric matrix containing the posterior probabilities for
each observation.}
\item{seq_loglik}{A numeric vector containing the sequence of log-likelihoods
measured initially and after each iteration.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model using the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Given an initial model, this
algorithm iteratively updates the parameters, monotonically increasing the
log-likelihood until convergence to a local maximum (Bilmes, 1998). A
Bayesian regularization is applied by default to prevent that a mixture
component comes down to a single point and leads to a zero covariance matrix
(Ormoneit and Tresp, 1996). Although the EM algorithm only applies to the
joint model, good parameters can be found for a derived conditional model.
However, care should be taken as the monotonic increase of the conditional
log-likelihood is not guaranteed.
